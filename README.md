# Tae's Writing Samples
Some examples of content that I've written:
- A wider range of technical samples are available that I can’t post due to confidentiality agreements. However, I can show them in a screenshare (such as a Google Hangout). Please let me know if you’d like to see any.
- Help content: PDF documents of online help as of March; published version may have been updated since then, but you can see the formatting by clicking links to the live articles
- User guides: PDF versions of printed manuals for Aspen LMS (Learning Management System)
