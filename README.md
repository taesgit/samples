# Tae's Writing Samples
Some examples of content that I've written:
- A wide range of technical samples are available that I need to show in person or by screenshare (such as a Google Hangout); they can't be posted publicly due to confidentially agreement. Please let me know if youâ€™d like to see any.
- Help Articles: PDF documents of online help as of March; published version may have been updated since then, but you can see the formatting by clicking links to the live articles.
- Aspen User Guides: PDF versions of printed manuals for Aspen LMS (Learning Management System).
