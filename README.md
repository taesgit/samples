# Tae's Writing Samples
Some examples of content that I've written:
- User guides: old stuff from way back
- Help content: formatting can be seen by clicking links to the live articles
- A wider range of technical samples are available that I can’t post due to confidentiality agreements. However, I can show them in a screenshare (such as a Google Hangout). Please let me know if you’d like to see any.
