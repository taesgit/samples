# Tae's Writing Samples
Some examples of content that I've written for my last two employers:
- Yahoo Finance Premium: The content of the initial help articles for premium subscription service launched in December. The published versions may have been updated since March, but you can see the formatting by clicking links to the live articles.
- Yahoo Finance Tanda: A product that was test launched in January 2018 but then discontinued the following may; an example of a complete product that I solely produced.
- The remaining samples were written for more technical audiences (support and implementation staff) at Huron Consulting Group.
