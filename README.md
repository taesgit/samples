# Tae's Writing Samples
Some examples of content that I've written for previous employers:
- Yahoo Finance Premium: The content of the initial help articles for the premium subscription service launched in December. The published versions may have been updated since March, but you can see the formatting by clicking links to the live articles
- Yahoo Finance Tanda: A product that was test-launched in January 2018 then discontinued the following May; a recent example of a complete product, short-lived as it was, that I solely produced
- How to Make a Sandwich: an exercise that was requested for a past application process
- Aspen documents: technical guides for installation and utilities for an LMS (Learning Management System)
